Excalidraw has become my go-to tool for creating technical diagrams. The hand-drawn aesthetic makes everything feel approachable and less intimidating than formal diagram tools.

## Why I Love It

- **Simplicity**: No complex menus or overwhelming options
- **Collaboration**: Real-time collaboration works seamlessly
- **Export options**: Can export to PNG, SVG, or even embed in other tools
- **Libraries**: Community-created libraries for AWS, system design patterns, etc.

## Use Cases

### System Architecture Diagrams
Perfect for sketching out microservices architectures, data flows, and system interactions. The casual style makes it great for early-stage design discussions.

### Technical Interviews
I often use Excalidraw during technical interviews to:
- Sketch out algorithms
- Draw system design solutions
- Explain complex concepts visually

### Documentation
The exported images work great in:
- README files
- Technical specifications
- Blog posts and presentations

## Pro Tips

1. **Use the library feature** - Save common components (databases, servers, etc.) for reuse
2. **Learn keyboard shortcuts** - Especially for duplicating elements (Ctrl+D)
3. **Use groups** - Group related elements to move them together
4. **Color coding** - Use consistent colors for different types of components

The combination of simplicity and power makes this an essential tool in my toolkit.
