GitHub Copilot has been a game-changer for my daily coding workflow. While it's not perfect, it's surprisingly good at understanding context and generating relevant code suggestions.

## What I Love

- **Boilerplate reduction**: Excellent at generating repetitive code patterns
- **Test writing**: Surprisingly good at writing unit tests when given good function names
- **Documentation**: Helps write clear comments and README sections
- **New language exploration**: Great for learning syntax in unfamiliar languages

## Limitations

- Sometimes suggests overly complex solutions when simple ones would work
- Can perpetuate bad practices if you're not careful
- Occasionally suggests deprecated APIs or patterns
- Still requires human review and understanding

## Best Practices I've Developed

1. **Use descriptive function/variable names** - Copilot works much better with clear context
2. **Write good comments** - Explain the intent, and Copilot often nails the implementation
3. **Review everything** - Never blindly accept suggestions
4. **Learn from it** - When it suggests something unfamiliar, take time to understand why

## Impact on Productivity

I'd estimate Copilot saves me about 20-30% of my typing time, especially for:
- Writing tests
- Creating configuration files
- Implementing common patterns
- Converting between similar data structures

The key is using it as a smart autocomplete rather than a replacement for thinking about the problem.
