### **Introduction**

Event streams provide a framework for processing and transmitting continuously generated data in distributed systems. Rather than relying on static batch files, streams enable real-time or near-real-time communication between producers and consumers. The challenge lies in efficiently transmitting these streams, ensuring scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance. This subchapter focuses on two key mechanisms: **messaging systems** and **partitioned logs**.

### **Messaging Systems**

A **messaging system** provides the foundation for transmitting events between producers and consumers. Unlike direct communication methods (e.g., HTTP or TCP connections), messaging systems decouple producers from consumers by introducing an intermediary called a **message broker**.

#### **How Messaging Systems Work**
1. Producers send events (messages) to a broker, often organized by **topics**.
2. The broker stores these messages temporarily or persistently.
3. Consumers subscribe to topics, receiving messages either in real-time or when they are ready to process them.

#### **Key Features of Messaging Systems**

1. **Durability with Message Brokers**    
   Message brokers, such as RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ, provide durability by writing messages to disk. This ensures resilience to failures, enabling consumers to retrieve messages that were stored before the crash of a producer or a consumer node.

2. **Load Balancing**    
   When multiple consumers subscribe to a topic, the broker can distribute messages in two ways:
    - **Load Balancing**: Distribute messages among consumers to parallelize processing.
    - **Fan-Out**: Broadcast all messages to every consumer subscribed to the topic.

#### **Limitations of Messaging Systems**
1. **Short-Term Storage**: Traditional brokers are optimized for transient workloads and delete messages after they are acknowledged. Therefore, they are unsuitable for long-term message storage.
2. **Message Ordering**: Depending on the configuration, messages may arrive out-of-order if brokers redistribute them following consumer failures.

### **Partitioned Logs**

A **log-based message broker** builds on the durable and append-only log structure seen in replication and storage engines. Well-known examples include **Apache Kafka** and **Amazon Kinesis**. These systems address some of the challenges of traditional brokers by retaining messages long-term and providing better reliability when dealing with unbounded streams.

#### **How Partitioned Logs Work**
1. Producers send events to a topic, which is divided into **partitions** for scalability. Each event in a partition is assigned a monotonically increasing **offset**, ensuring per-partition message order.
2. Consumers independently read from assigned partitions at their own pace, tracking offsets to avoid reprocessing.

#### **Advantages of Log-Based Brokers**
1. **Persistence for Long-Term Availability**: Unlike traditional brokers, logs retain messages until they are explicitly deleted. This allows new consumers to replay past events and catch up on historical data.
2. **Fan-Out Without Performance Loss**: Multiple consumers can read the same data from partitions without affecting each other, enabling efficient stream processing and replication tasks.
3. **Efficient Sequential Reads**: Consumers read sequentially from partitions, enabling high throughput.

### **Message Broker vs. Partitioned Log**

| **Aspect**                | **Traditional Message Broker**       | **Log-Based Broker**                |    
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|    
| **Message Retention**     | Messages are deleted after acknowledgment.  | Messages are retained until explicitly deleted.  |    
| **Delivery Mechanism**    | Push-based (broker pushes messages to consumer). | Pull-based (consumer reads messages from log). |    
| **Message Ordering**      | Limited guarantees, may vary during redelivery. | Strong per-partition ordering guarantees. |    
| **Scalability**           | Limited by broker processing capacity.  | Horizontal scalability via partitions. |

### **Challenges in Event Transmission**

Regardless of the mechanism, transmitting event streams presents inherent challenges:

1. **Backpressure and Overload**
    - In traditional brokers, unbounded queues caused by slow consumers risk degrading overall performance.
    - Partitioned logs mitigate this by allowing streams to accumulate independently per partition.

2. **Crash Recovery**
    - Brokers use acknowledgments to confirm message delivery, relying on replays to recover unprocessed messages.

3. **Distributed Order Guarantees**
    - Partition-level ordering ensures integrity within each topic. However, maintaining order across partitions adds complexity and is generally avoided unless explicitly needed.

### **Conclusion**

Messaging systems and partitioned logs represent two complementary approaches to transmitting event streams in distributed systems. Traditional brokers excel at transient workloads, while log-based brokers offer persistent storage, replayability, and scalability. By understanding the trade-offs between these mechanisms, engineers can design stream-based architectures that balance performance, reliability, and durabilityâ€”key pillars for modern data-intensive applications.
