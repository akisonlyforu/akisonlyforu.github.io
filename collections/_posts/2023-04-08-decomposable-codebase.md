The question of whether a monolithic codebase is decomposable lies at the crux of architectural decomposition. This post explores techniques and metrics—afferent and efferent coupling, abstractness and instability, and distance from the main sequence—that help assess the feasibility of breaking down monolithic architectures into manageable components.

## Determining Decomposability

A disorganized system—commonly referred to as the Big Ball of Mud anti-pattern—poses immense challenges for decomposition. Such systems often lack modularity or structure, requiring architects to evaluate whether restructuring the codebase is a viable approach.

Key considerations include:
1. **Can the codebase be salvaged?**
2. **Is decomposition suitable, or should tactical refactoring strategies like forking be considered?**
3. **What internal metrics and macro characteristics define this decision?**

## Analyzing Metrics

### 1. Afferent and Efferent Coupling

- Afferent coupling measures the incoming dependencies to a class or component.
- Efferent coupling focuses on outgoing dependencies to other components.

These indicators help architects evaluate interdependencies and spot critical areas in the system. Tools like JDepend visualize these coupling characteristics for easier analysis.

### 2. Abstractness and Instability

Robert Martin introduced two key metrics:

- **Abstractness**: Measures the ratio of abstract components, like interfaces, to concrete implementations. Highly abstract designs are clearer and easier to decompose.
- **Instability**: Looks at the ratio of efferent coupling to the sum of efferent and afferent couplings. Higher instability often signals brittle intersections in monolithic systems.

Evaluating both parameters together provides a clearer picture of decomposition complexity.

### 3. Distance from the Main Sequence

This metric balances abstractness and instability.

- Components on the main sequence are well-balanced between abstraction and stability.
- Those straying too far fall into zones of pain (excessive implementation) or zones of uselessness (over-abstraction), hampering decomposition efforts.

## Steps to Proceed

For decomposable codebases, architects can adopt approaches like:

1. **Component-Based Decomposition**    
   Breaking down logical components as building blocks toward distributed systems.

2. **Tactical Forking**    
   Simplify the application by cloning and deleting irrelevant portions in tightly-coupled systems.

## Conclusion

Through metrics like afferent coupling, abstractness, and main sequence proximity, architects can make informed decisions about the decomposability of monolithic systems. A focused analysis leads to effective strategies—whether gradual restructuring or tactical removal—ensuring modern, scalable architectures.

Let’s continue the conversation. How do you approach assessing decomposability in your projects?
